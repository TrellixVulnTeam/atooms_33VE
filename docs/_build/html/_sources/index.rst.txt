Atooms
======

**atooms** is a Python framework for simulations of interacting particles. It makes it easy to develop simulation and analysis tools using an expressive language, without sacrificing efficiency. To achieve this, atooms relies on backends written in C, CUDA or Fortran.

This tutorial guides you through some of the features of **atooms**. You can run this tutorial live on Binder or by downloading the jupyter notebooks from the Framagit repository.
